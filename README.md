# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System 🎬

This **Movie Recommendation System** uses **Content-Based Filtering** and **Cosine Similarity** to recommend movies to users based on the content of movies they have liked. The system analyzes the features of the movies, such as genres, descriptions, and other metadata, to suggest similar movies.

## ✨ Key Features:

- 🎥 **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of content (e.g., genre, plot) to movies the user has shown interest in.
  
- 📏 **Cosine Similarity**: Uses Cosine Similarity to calculate the similarity between movies, ensuring accurate and relevant recommendations.

- 🧑‍💻 **Simple Interface**: Allows users to input their movie preferences and receive personalized recommendations.

- 📊 **Scalable Recommendations**: Capable of recommending a large number of movies based on user interests.

## 💻 Technologies Used:

- 🐍 **Python**: The core programming language used to implement the recommendation system.

- 📚 **Pandas**: For data manipulation and handling movie datasets.

- 🔢 **Scikit-learn**: For computing Cosine Similarity and other machine learning utilities.

- 📝 **Numpy**: For numerical operations and calculations.

- 📈 **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and results.
